Climate Sensitivity Estimated From Temperature Reconstructions of the Last Glacial Maximum, Science.

 
The Bartlein et al. (2010) dataset is available here: http://www.springerlink.com/content/2762k2451307l623/382_2010_Article_904_ESM.html.
 

The MARGO (2009) dataset is available at NOAA (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/margo2009/margo2009.html). 
Using these data I've produced a netcdf file that you can download here: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/margo09.nc.

Shakun et al. LGM temperature anomalies are available as a combined excel file (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/LGM_deltaT_synthesis_Shakun_etal_2011.xlsx), or as three separate netcdf files containing updated MARGO grid points (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/dt_updated_MARGO.nc), other ocean grid points (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/dt_other_ocean.nc), and land grid points (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/dt_other_land_2x2.nc) on a 2x2 grid. Note that the updates MARGO grid points should replace the corresponding data in the original MARGO dataset. Table with references (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/Shakun_table.pdf).

Here are results from the UVic model simulations from the pre-industrial control and LGM simulations: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/sat_sst_aice.tar.gz

Here are the probability density functions PDFs (Figure 3; http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/ECS_pdfs.txt) and the random samples from the Markov chains (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/data/schmittner11sci/ECS_chains.txt.gz) from which the pdfs were derived.

LGM dust forcing fields are here:
