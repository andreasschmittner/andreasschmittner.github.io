	c13.nc contains modeled d13C_dic and d13C_cib from the PIC and best fitting LGM (LGM_8_SOFe) 
		simulations from Muglia et al. (2018, EPSL,  doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2018.05.038)
	d13C_cib = A + B*d13C_DIC, with A = 0.11, B = 0.89
		this is calibration LA6 from Schmittner et al. (2017, PO, doi:10.1002/2016PA003072)
		see their Tab. 2
	The model data have been extrapolated out two grid points in order to increase the overlapp with
		the observations
	d13c_cib_obs are the observations mapped on the model grid
	n15.nc contains modeled d15N_detr from the same experiments as above
	ep.nc contains export production at 120 m
	c13_data.csv and n15_data.csv contain the data
	the bulk d15N data are already diagenesis corrected
