These files contains the combined d13C dataset described in Schmittner et al. (2013) Biogeosciences

d13c.dat is an ascii file.
Its collumns contain the following variables:
longitude,latitude,month,day,year,depth,temperature,salility,cfc11,cfc12,total co2,alkalinity,anthropogenic co2, radiocarbon (d14c), d13c, apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), potential tempearature,sigma 0,sigma 2,sigma 4
It can be read from a fortran program using the simple synthax:

      progam readdata
      real lon,lat,depth,temp,salt,cfc11,cfc12,tco2
      real alk,aco2,d14c,d13c,aou,pottemp,sig0,sig2,sig4
      integer mon,day,year
      open(2,file="d13c.dat")
 1    read(2,*,end=100) lon,lat,mon,day,year,depth,temp,salt
     &,cfc11,cfc12,tco2,alk,aco2,d14c,d13c,aou,pottemp,sig0,sig2,sig4
      goto 1
 100  continue
      end

d13c.nc is a netcdf file containing the data gridded on the World Ocean Atlas Grid.

c13_CDIAC.xlsx is an excel file including the CDIAC data only.
