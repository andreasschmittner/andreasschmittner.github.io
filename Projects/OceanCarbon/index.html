<h2> Description </h2>
<p>The ocean's carbon cycle is an important part of Earth's climate system because it impacts the concentration 
of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which is a greenhouse gas. However, carbon cycling in the ocean 
is currently not well understood in part because it is influenced by different complex physical, chemical and 
biological processes. This complicates quantification of changes in ocean carbon storage such as those between 
the contemporary ocean and that of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21,000 years ago) and hinders mechanistic 
understanding of the reasons for such changes. Previous studies have suggested several explanations for the lower 
atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations during the LGM including, increased sea ice cover, more sluggish deep 
ocean circulation, cooler temperatures and increased dust-borne iron fluxes that fertilized phytoplankton growth. 
This project will provide a novel data-constrained quantification of these processes based on the method of 
Khatiwala et al. (2019), which will improve our 
mechanistic understanding of past changes, and may improve understanding of possible future projections. A 
graduate student will be trained in oceanography, biogeochemical and physical modeling. 
This is a project that is jointly funded by 
the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research 
Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement.</p>

<p>Modern observations and paleoclimate data provide a wealth of information on changes to the carbon cycle. These 
data including carbon and nitrogen isotopes from glacial sediments will be used to constrain process-based 
models of the modern and LGM ocean. A newly developed method will be applied that provides a precise and 
complete decomposition of dissolved inorganic carbon storage into preformed and biologically-regenerated 
components. Preformed carbon is further separated into saturation and disequilibrium components, each of which 
has physical and biological contributions. Perturbation experiments will be used in which one variable 
(temperature, sea ice, circulation, soluble iron fluxes) is changed at a time and the carbon decomposition is 
applied. Uncertainties in circulation, mixing, and biogeochemistry will be considered. Protactinium thorium 
ratios (Pa/Th) will be implemented in the model and compared with modern and glacial sediment data, which will 
provide additional constraints on ocean circulation. Effects of ocean circulation changes on the different carbon 
components will be investigated. The decomposition will be extended to dissolved oxygen and carbon isotopes 
(&delta;<sup>13</sup>C). Hypotheses regarding modern and glacial ocean carbon storage will be tested.</p>

<h2> Funded by </h2> <p>the National Science Foundation's Chemical Oceanography and Marine Geology and Geophysics Programs</p>

<div><a id="data"><h2>Outreach</h2></a>
<p>The project will support underrepresented students through more than 25 afterschool Science Technology 
Engineering and Mathematics clubs in rural Oregon middle and high schools. This will be achieved by working 
with teachers to develop and implement a carbon cycle and climate science curriculum into their programs as 
part of OSU's Science and Math Investigative Lerning Experiences (SMILE) program. </p>
