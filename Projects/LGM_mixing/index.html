<h2> Description </h2>
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>Small-scale mixing in the ocean interior impacts the large-scale global meridional overturning circulation and tracer distributions. However, not much is known about how and why mixing has changed in the past and its impacts on circulation, climate and biogeochemical cycles. Here we propose to study mixing in the modern and glacial ocean through a combination of new numerical modeling and existing observations. The concept of an energetically consistent parameterization of diapycnal mixing will be explored in the global coarse-resolution ocean component of an intermediate complexity climate model. Parameterizations of mesoscale eddies will also be evaluated. The model will be calibrated with modern observations including physical and biogeochemical tracer distributions, and microstructure-based diffusivity estimates. Subsequently, it will be applied to the glacial ocean in a suite of experiments that cover uncertainties in forcing, circulation state and tidal energy input to the internal wave field. Glacial sediment data will be used to evaluate the model simulations and test hypotheses regarding effects of stratification, circulation geometry and tides on diapycnal mixing and effects of southern hemisphere wind changes on the carbon cycle and atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Merit</h3>
<p>Mixing and the meridional overturning circulation during the last glacial period remain controversial. Shoaling of the interface between North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water and increased stratification are two mechanisms that have been suggested to reduce diapycnal mixing. On the other hand, a shift of tidal energy input from the continental shelves to the deep ocean due to sea level lowering has been hypothesized to increase diapycnal mixing. Here we will test these hypotheses by quantifying their effects in an energetically consistent model of internal wave-driven mixing. We will also evaluate the idea that changes in southern hemisphere winds affected past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Previous tests of this idea have used models without eddy compensation, which has been shown to reduce physical model responses to wind changes but has so-far not been applied to past changes of the carbon cycle. Here we hypothesize that including eddy compensation will greatly reduce the response of atmospheric carbon dioxide to wind changes.</p>

<h3>Broader Impacts</h3>
<p>Previous paleoclimate modeling intercomparison projects did not consider changes in tidal energy input and most model studies of wind effects on the carbon cycle did not consider eddy compensation. The results from this project may thus impact future paleoclimate modeling by highlighting the importance of these two issues. The project will also foster connections between physical oceanographers and paleoceanographers, two communities with few interactions.

The expanded set of model experiments has the potential to advance our understanding of the glacial meridional overturning circulation and carbon cycle, which remain controversial. Implementation of the energetically consistent parameterization of internal wave-driven mixing in two widely used climate models will benefit the climate modeling community by enhancing the technological resources available to them. The newly developed and tested code, together with a user guide and documentation will be posted on a publicly accessible code sharing site while a webinar will be conducted to facilitate its use. Together with the results from the parameter sensitivity tests with the intermediate complexity model these activities will facilitate implementation of this innovative scheme in other models and its application by a broad group of climate model users, thus enhancing the technological infrastructure of climate research. 

Public views of the causes of climate change are much different from those of climate scientists. Here we will conduct public meetings and discussions with climate scientists designed to reduce this gap, increase climate literacy and foster interactions between the public and scientists. A graduate student will design and evaluate these activities. An early-career scientist will be involved in an interdisciplinary project at the interface of physical oceanography, paleoceanography and biogeochemistry, and receive science, and science communication training. A hands-on activity for visitors of a local science museum will engage family groups in oceanography and thus enhance informal STEM learning.
